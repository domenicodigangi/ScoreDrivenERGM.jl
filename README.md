# SDERGM
julia package for Score Driven Exponential Random Graphs Models, as proposed in the paper Score-Driven Exponential Random Graphs: A New Class of Time-Varying Parameter Models for Dynamical Networks https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3394593

### ERGM - Exponential Random Graph Models
A statistical model for graphs can be specified providing the probability distribution over the set of possible graphs, i.e. all possible adjacency matrices. If the distribution belongs to the exponential family, than the model is named ERGM.
### Score Driven (SD) Models, aka Generalized Autoregressive Score Models (GAS), aka Dynamically Conditional Score Models (DCS)

## SDERGM depends on R - ergm
Some methods and scripts related with global stastistics (not the fitness models) require Julia to call multiple R Libraries. For this interface to work, a working installation of R and the ergm package is required. We aknowledge the importance of this library for our analysis. For further information, please refer to

## SDERGM is a Work in Progress
- This repository is an attempt at packaging the code from a research project. It is not a finished package by any means. The dependency on R-ergm, and the total lack of testing,  prevent the release 
  
- the fitness model has not been updated to the latest version of the codebase, hence is not currently working. For a working fitness model checkout commits from 2019. I would be glad to update it upon request. Also a python version of only the fitness model might be released upon request.
