SDERGM

julia package for Score Driven Exponential Random Graphs Models, as proposed in the paper Score-Driven Exponential Random Graphs: A New Class of Time-Varying Parameter Models for Dynamical Networks https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3394593


This repository is still a work in progress and can contain bugs.


Some methods and scripts related with global stastistics (not the fitness models) require Julia to call multiple R Libraries. For this interface to work, a working installation of R and statnet is required. We aknowledge the importance of this library for our analysis. For further information, please refer to
